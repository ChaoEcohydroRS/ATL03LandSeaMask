## Overview
(A statement of need
The authors should clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve, who the target audience is, and its relation to other work.)

This is a repository for publishing “An Open-Source Tool for Updating ICESat-2 ATL03 Land-Sea Masks with High-Resolution Shoreline Datasets”

The ATL03LandSeaMask is a tool designed to Update ICESat-2 ATL03 Land Sea Mask with high-resolution shoreline dataset. This repository is home to the code and materials for the publication "An Open-Source Tool for Updating ICESat-2 ATL03 Land-Sea Masks with High-Resolution Shoreline Datasets."

## Main subject of the paper
The main subject of this paper is to develop an open-source tool for updating ICESat-2 ATL03 Land-Sea Masks with high-resolution shoreline datasets. Specifically, the tool focuses on:

Processing ICESat-2 h5 Files: Sorting ICEsat-2 h5 files based on photon return signature, which is a unique characteristic of the light signal received by the satellite.
Landmask Application: Applying a landmask to h5 files to remove data points likely taken from land, enhancing the analysis of water bodies.
The paper likely discusses the methodology, implementation, and applications of this tool, providing insights into the enhancement of ICESat-2 data processing and analysis.

## Features

- **Processing ICESat-2 h5 Files**: The tool enables the sorting of ICEsat-2 h5 files based on photon return signature.
- **Landmask Application**: The application of a landmask to h5 files ensures that data points likely taken from land are removed, allowing for precise analysis of water bodies.
